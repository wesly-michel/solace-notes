# Solace Notes App

Instructions to run locallty
- Download the repo https://github.com/wesly-michel/solace-notes.git
- run node server.js in backend/ directory
- run npm run dev in solace-notes/src directory
- access url in terminal

Changes I would implement
- Run search on db instead of data
- add pagination
- more styling to notes
- ability to add media

 Challenges
- easy setup on both AWS Amplify and Vercel, but backend was a bit of a challenge / requires rewrite of code√ü
- use of friendly urls instead of id
